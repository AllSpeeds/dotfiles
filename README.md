My personal OS X dotfiles

Heavily based on [addyosmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles)'s dotfiles.

Work in progress.

## Files Overview

#### Shell Environment
* `.aliases`
	* SpotifyControl

#### Homebrew dotfile

You can use the `.brew` file by running it as a shell script in your terminal.

```

```

#### SCSS Lint Configuration Overrides
